# SebAuthenticatorBundle

Simple authentication library based on Symfony Guards. 
The AuthenticatorInterface has been split into sub interfaces, allowing to mix and match different authentication policies.

## Examples

At the moment there is no documentation, but you can take a loot at https://github.com/exeba/wallabag/tree/imap-auth
where it is used to allow login both from local accounts and imap accounts
